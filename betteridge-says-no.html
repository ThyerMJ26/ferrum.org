<div class="s1">
<span class="s2">
Russel's Paradox demonstrates that unrestricted set-theory can lead to contradictions.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Similarly, unrestricted logical statements, such as the Liar Paradox, can lead to contradictions.
</span>
<span class="s3">
To make set-theory consistent (free of contradictions), restrictions must be imposed.
</span>
<br>
</div>

<h2>
Set Theory
</h2>
<div class="s1">
<span class="s2">
This is the problematic construction:
</span>
<span class="s3">
{ x | x ∉ x }
</span>
<span class="s3">
Different set-theories forbid it on different grounds.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF) forbids this because "x" is not drawn from an already existing set.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Quine's New Foundations (NF) forbids this because "x" is used on both sides of the negated set-membership "∉" operator. (In NF terms, the predicate "x ∉ x" is not stratified)
</span>
<span class="s3">
Whichever rules are used to prevent contradictions, will also forbid some otherwise non-problematic constructions.
</span>
<span class="s3">
For example, NF permits the universal set, whereas ZF forbids it.
</span>
<span class="s3">
(Examples of sets permited in ZF but not NF exist, but are a bit more involved.)

<h2>
Type Theory
</h2>
<div class="s1">
<span class="s2">
Type-theory was invented to stop philosopher's talking nonsense.
</span>
<span class="s3">
At first glance, the problem with the Liar Paradox is self-reference.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Quine's paradox demonstrates that contradictions can arise without self-reference.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Type theory can prevent the construction of such contradictory sentences.
</span>
<span class="s3">
However, as with set theory, any specific type theory will forbid meaningful terms as well as contradictory ones.
</span>
<br>
</div>
</section>
<section class="s0">
<h2>
Computation
</h2>
<div class="s1">
<span class="s2">
As well as contradictory/meaningless sets and sentences, we can have contradictory programs:
</span>
<span class="s3">
function f() { return !f(); }
</span>
<span class="s3">
If this function returns true, it returns false, and if it returns false, it returns true.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Type systems for most programming languages don't concern themselves with termination.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Type theory, on the other hand, does.
</span>
<br>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<span class="s2">
The dividng line between sense and nonsense appears to be the same as the dividing line between total (always terminating) and partial (sometimes non-terminating) functions.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Programmers are already accustomed to being responsible for ensuring their programs terminate.
</span>
<br>
</div>
<div class="s1">
<span class="s2">
Perhaps we can be less rigid in forbidding problematic sets by defining a permitted set, as a set with a total predicate function.
</span>
<span class="s3">
This isn't a decidable definitions, because the halting problem isn't decidable.
</span>
<span class="s3">
NF provides one particular way of ensuring only total predicates can be formed.
</span>
<span class="s3">
But if we need more expressability, any method of proving that a predicate is total is valid.
</span>

<h2>
Theorem Proving
</h2>
<div class="s1">
<span class="s2">
Theorem proving and type-checking have a close correspondence.
</span>
<span class="s3">
However, Ferrum's type-system is primarily inteded to be useful for programming, and specializing and translating code.
</span>
<span class="s3">
A type-check is only a valid proof if termination is also proved.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Languages for theorem provers typically ensure only terminating programs can be written.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Ferrum could be equipped with primitives which only allow you to write terminating programs.
</span>
<span class="s3">
Ferrum's type-system could be refined to treat total-functions as a subtype of partial-functions.
</span>
<span class="s3">
At present, termination is left as the responsibility of the programmer.
